/**
 * HOMEWORK_1
 * 
 * This package includes of two classes on where the one is used as a type class for creating objects(BalancedTernary) 
 * for Balanced Ternary Numbers and the another class for describing and helping the representation of an expression
 * (Expression).In this program we generate some simple mathematical expression and functions on BalancedTernary 
 * numbers.The program has many methods such as REPL() for the interface of computer and people which helps for the
 * better functionality of the program.Although the program isn't as simple as it was predestined.The program can make
 * some great functions which can help the user understand his/her mistake but also help him in some mathematical 
 * calculations.It offers not only the calculation of BalancedTernary Numbers,but also decimal,giving priority to 
 *  calculating Balanced Numbers!The only method that communicates with the user is REPL() which is in class 
 *  BalancedTernary!Last this program follows all the instructions from the exercises, even though it has some more 
 *  functions helping the user to make some more specified actions easily!
 *   
 *   Classes:
 *    {@link BalancedTernary#}
 *    
 *    {@link Expression}
